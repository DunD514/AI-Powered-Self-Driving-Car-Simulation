# AI-Powered-Self-Driving-Car-Simulation
This project simulates a self-driving car using computer vision and real-time object detection. It uses YOLOv8 (via Ultralytics), OpenCV, and pyttsx3 to analyze video input, detect obstacles like vehicles and pedestrians, make decisions (like slowing down or stopping), and even provide voice feedback.
